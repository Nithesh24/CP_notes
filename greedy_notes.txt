- greedy is basically taking local optima at each step to get global optima
- to prove your greedy approach is wrong best way to find counter test case (its tricky in some cases)

** |i - j | + |j - k| = |i - k| if i <= j <= k (very important)
	similar one is if can jump a to b taking value in between that will reach <= b is point less

- silly mistake : number of prime factors doesn't increase with increase in number
